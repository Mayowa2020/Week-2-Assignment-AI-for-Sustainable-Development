# 🌍 Predicting Disease Outbreaks with Machine Learning  

### Advancing SDG 3 — Good Health and Well-Being  

---

## 🩺 Introduction  

Health is the foundation of sustainable development. Yet every year, vector-borne diseases such as **dengue fever**, **malaria**, and **Zika virus** threaten millions of lives — especially in tropical regions.  

Despite advances in medicine, many outbreaks are detected **too late** for effective intervention. Early prediction can save countless lives — and this is where **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** steps in.  

This project, titled **Dengue Disease Outbreak Predictor**, directly supports the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3)**:  

> “Ensure healthy lives and promotes well-being for all at all ages.”

By leveraging machine learning, the project aims to **forecast dengue outbreaks** using environmental and historical health data — empowering public health authorities to act **before** an epidemic escalates.

## 🌿 Understanding the Problem — SDG 3 and Global Health Challenges  

According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, the global incidence of dengue has increased **eightfold** in the past two decades. Traditional surveillance systems rely on manual data collection — often reactive rather than predictive.  

By the time case numbers rise, the virus has already spread. The consequences are severe:  

- 🏥 Hospitals become overwhelmed  
- 🦟 Vector control begins too late  
- 💰 Governments face higher healthcare costs and productivity losses  

To achieve SDG 3 targets — particularly:  

- **3.3** → End epidemics of communicable diseases  
- **3.d** → Strengthen capacity for early warning and health risk management  

we must adopt intelligent systems that **anticipate** outbreaks rather than react to them.

## 🤖 The AI-Driven Solution  

The **Disease Outbreak Predictor** applies **supervised machine learning** to analyze climate, environmental, and epidemiological data for forecasting dengue case counts in advance.  

Key predictive features include:  

- 🌡️ Temperature, rainfall, humidity  
- 🌱 Vegetation indices (NDVI)  
- 📈 Historical case counts and temporal trends  

The model uses open-source datasets from **Kaggle** ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility.

## ⚙️ How the Model Works  

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  

- Handle missing values via median imputation  
- Merge weekly dengue case counts with environmental data  
- Create lag and rolling features for previous weeks  
- Encode cyclical seasonal features (week of year using sine/cosine)  

### 2️⃣ Model Training  

A **Random Forest Regressor** is employed — a robust ensemble algorithm capable of modeling non-linear relationships between climate and disease spread while providing feature importance insights.  

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation  

Performance metrics include:  

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**  

### 4️⃣ Visualization  

Plots show predicted vs. actual dengue cases and top influencing features, helping interpret results and validate predictions.

## ⚖️ Ethical and Social Considerations  

AI in healthcare must be developed responsibly:  

- **🧩 Data Bias:** Underreporting in low-resource areas can skew predictions — mitigation includes regional calibration.  
- **👥 Fairness:** Model predictions are designed to assist, not replace, expert epidemiologists.  
- **🔒 Privacy:** Uses aggregated, anonymized public data only.  
- **🌱 Sustainability:** Lightweight design allows deployment on modest hardware — ideal for developing regions.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  

Potential next steps include:  

- 🔹 Integration of **real-time weather and IoT data**  
- 🔹 Expansion to other diseases (malaria, cholera)  
- 🔹 **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visualization  
- 🔹 **Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)** for scalability  
- 🔹 Adding **probabilistic forecasting** for uncertainty quantification
